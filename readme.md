# LionREST

LionREST provides a simple way to define a type-safe REST API in TypeScript **without the need for code generation.**

While OpenAPI and the like are great for larger projects, they ultimately add a ton of complexity to your workflow and the schema definition language is too verbose for simpler projects when all you want is type safety in your REST API.
